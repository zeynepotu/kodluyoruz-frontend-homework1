    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a hardworking and ambitious
        individual with a great passion for
        the coding and information
        technologies industry. I am
        currently in my third year of
        studying Computer Engineering at
        Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University.
        I have excellent communication
        skills, enabling me to effectively
        communicate with a wide range of
        people. I am seeing a part-time
        position in the industry in which I
        can put into practice my
        knowledge and experience,
        ultimately benefiting the
        operations of the organisation that
        I work for.
        I teached voluntary design
        education for children.
